      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I graduated from high school 2 years ago and tried to go to a four year university but realized I was ready to get to work and couldn't waste any more time and that's how I'm here.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Fountain Hills, Arizona</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> I'm a huge nerd so I play alot of Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and more table top games. I also really love sports so you can catch me always watching a game or even playing in a rec league.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Like most people I'd love to just sit and collect a million dollars while doing nothing but realistically I want to be a Game developer for 2k Sports, specifically NBA 2k. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Fountain Hills Arizona curerently but I'm looking to move within the next year or so.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Probably because of the endless possibilities that you can do on the web. Also knowing that the Tech Industry will most likely live forever it's nice to know that jobs (hopefully) wont go away.</p>
